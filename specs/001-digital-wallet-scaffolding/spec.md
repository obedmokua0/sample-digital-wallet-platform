# Feature Specification: Wallet Microservice

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a simple wallet microservice, using the best practices for this kind of service. I want it to simply allow me to move funds around. I want to use event-driven architectures, I want to build 12-factor apps."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Wallet and Check Balance (Priority: P1)

A user needs to create a wallet to hold funds and be able to view their current balance at any time. This is the foundational capability that enables all other wallet operations.

**Why this priority**: Without the ability to create wallets and check balances, no other wallet operations are possible. This is the absolute minimum viable product that delivers tangible value - users can see their money.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a wallet via API, receiving a wallet ID, and successfully retrieving the balance (initially 0). This delivers the value of account creation and balance visibility without requiring any fund movement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no existing wallet for user, **When** user requests wallet creation with valid user ID, **Then** system creates wallet with unique ID, initial balance of 0, and returns wallet details
2. **Given** an existing wallet, **When** user requests balance for their wallet ID, **Then** system returns current balance and currency
3. **Given** an invalid wallet ID, **When** user requests balance, **Then** system returns "wallet not found" error
4. **Given** a wallet with transactions, **When** user requests balance, **Then** system returns accurate balance reflecting all completed transactions

### User Story 2 - Deposit Funds (Priority: P2)

A user needs to add funds to their wallet to increase their available balance. This enables users to actually use the wallet for its core purpose - holding money.

**Why this priority**: After wallet creation (P1), the most critical next step is allowing users to add funds. Without deposits, wallets remain at zero balance and provide no utility. This is the second piece of the MVP that makes the system useful.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a wallet (from P1), submitting a deposit request with an amount, and verifying the balance increases by the deposited amount. Events are published for successful deposits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a wallet with balance of $100, **When** user deposits $50, **Then** balance increases to $150 and a deposit event is published
2. **Given** a wallet, **When** user attempts to deposit $0 or negative amount, **Then** system rejects with "invalid amount" error
3. **Given** a wallet, **When** user deposits with invalid currency, **Then** system rejects with "invalid currency" error
4. **Given** a wallet, **When** deposit succeeds, **Then** system publishes "funds.deposited" event with wallet ID, amount, currency, and timestamp
5. **Given** a wallet, **When** user deposits amount exceeding maximum single transaction limit, **Then** system rejects with "amount exceeds limit" error

---

### User Story 3 - Withdraw Funds (Priority: P3)

A user needs to remove funds from their wallet, reducing their available balance. This completes the basic wallet lifecycle by allowing users to retrieve their money.

**Why this priority**: While important, withdrawals are less critical than deposits since users need funds in the wallet before they can withdraw. This is still part of core functionality but builds on P1 and P2.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a wallet (P1), depositing funds (P2), then withdrawing a smaller amount and verifying the balance decreases. Events are published for successful withdrawals.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a wallet with balance of $100, **When** user withdraws $30, **Then** balance decreases to $70 and a withdrawal event is published
2. **Given** a wallet with balance of $100, **When** user attempts to withdraw $150, **Then** system rejects with "insufficient funds" error
3. **Given** a wallet with balance of $0, **When** user attempts to withdraw any amount, **Then** system rejects with "insufficient funds" error
4. **Given** a wallet, **When** user attempts to withdraw $0 or negative amount, **Then** system rejects with "invalid amount" error
5. **Given** a wallet, **When** withdrawal succeeds, **Then** system publishes "funds.withdrawn" event with wallet ID, amount, currency, and timestamp

---

### User Story 4 - Transfer Between Wallets (Priority: P4)

A user needs to transfer funds from their wallet to another user's wallet. This enables peer-to-peer transactions and is the most complex fund movement operation.

**Why this priority**: Transfers build on all previous stories and represent more advanced functionality. While valuable, a wallet system can function with just deposits and withdrawals initially. This is an enhancement rather than core MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating two wallets (P1), depositing funds to the source wallet (P2), executing a transfer, and verifying the source balance decreased and destination balance increased by the same amount. Events are published for both debit and credit operations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** wallet A with balance $100 and wallet B with balance $50, **When** user transfers $30 from A to B, **Then** wallet A has $70, wallet B has $80, and transfer events are published
2. **Given** wallet A with balance $50, **When** user attempts to transfer $75 to wallet B, **Then** system rejects with "insufficient funds" error and no balances change
3. **Given** wallet A, **When** user attempts to transfer to non-existent wallet, **Then** system rejects with "destination wallet not found" error
4. **Given** wallet A, **When** user attempts to transfer to the same wallet (A to A), **Then** system rejects with "cannot transfer to same wallet" error
5. **Given** wallet A and B with different currencies, **When** user attempts transfer, **Then** system rejects with "currency mismatch" error [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should currency conversion be supported?]
6. **Given** wallet A, **When** transfer succeeds, **Then** system publishes "funds.transferred.debited" event for source and "funds.transferred.credited" event for destination, both with transaction ID for correlation

---

### User Story 5 - View Transaction History (Priority: P5)

A user needs to view the history of all transactions affecting their wallet to understand how their balance has changed over time. This provides audit trail and transparency.

**Why this priority**: While valuable for users, transaction history is a read-only reporting feature that doesn't affect core wallet operations. It can be built after all fund movement capabilities are working.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a wallet, performing several operations (deposit, withdraw, transfer), then retrieving the transaction history and verifying all operations are listed with correct amounts, types, and timestamps.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a wallet with 5 completed transactions, **When** user requests transaction history, **Then** system returns list of 5 transactions ordered by timestamp (newest first)
2. **Given** a new wallet with no transactions, **When** user requests transaction history, **Then** system returns empty list
3. **Given** a wallet, **When** user requests transaction history with pagination (page 1, size 10), **Then** system returns up to 10 most recent transactions and pagination metadata
4. **Given** a wallet, **When** user requests transaction history filtered by type (e.g., only deposits), **Then** system returns only transactions matching the filter
5. **Given** a wallet, **When** user requests transaction history for date range, **Then** system returns only transactions within specified dates

### Edge Cases

- What happens when concurrent deposits/withdrawals occur on the same wallet simultaneously?
- How does the system handle partial failures in transfer operations (debit succeeds but credit fails)?
- What happens when event publishing fails after a transaction is committed to the database?
- How does the system recover from database connection failures during a transaction?
- What happens when a wallet exceeds maximum balance limit?
- How does the system handle clock skew or timestamp inconsistencies?
- What happens when a user requests extremely large transaction history (millions of records)?
- How does the system behave during database failover or network partitions?
- What happens when invalid currency codes are provided?
- How does the system handle duplicate transaction requests (idempotency)?
