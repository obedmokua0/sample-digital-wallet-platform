# Tasks: Wallet Microservice

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-i-want-to/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED following constitutional TDD principles - tests must be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single microservice**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root (wallet-service/)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Outbox Publishing (Phase 8)**: Depends on at least US1-US2 being complete (events exist)
- **Rate Limiting (Phase 9)**: Depends on US1-US4 being complete (routes exist)
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Reuses wallet from US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Reuses wallet and transaction service pattern
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - More complex but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Read-only, no dependencies

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Models before repositories
- Repositories before services
- Services before routes
- Routes before integration tests pass
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (T002, T003, T004)
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within Phase 2
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All contract tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can be created in parallel (T022, T023, T024)
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- All Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

Task T010: "Create structured logger in src/utils/logger.ts"
Task T011: "Create error handling utilities in src/utils/errors.ts"
Task T012: "Create validation utilities in src/utils/validators.ts"

# Then launch:
Task T016: "Create health check routes in src/api/routes/health.ts"
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all contract tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T018: "Contract test for POST /api/v1/wallets"
Task T019: "Contract test for GET /api/v1/wallets/:id"
Task T020: "Contract test for GET /api/v1/wallets/:id/balance"
Task T021: "Integration test for create wallet user journey"

# Then launch all models together:
Task T022: "Create Wallet entity/model"
Task T023: "Create Transaction entity/model"
Task T024: "Create OutboxEvent entity/model"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests FAIL before implementing (TDD requirement)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Follow constitutional principles: TypeScript strict mode, TSDoc comments, TDD
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

**Total Tasks**: 75 tasks across 10 phases

**Estimated Completion Time**: 
- MVP (Phases 1-3): 5-7 days
- Full Feature (Phases 1-7): 10-14 days
- Production Ready (All phases): 15-20 days
